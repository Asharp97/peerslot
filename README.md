# PeerSlot

Policy-aware scheduling for student meetings.

PeerSlot is a small scheduling application for teachers, tutors, mentors, and
student-support teams. Teachers publish the times when they are available, and
students can move an existing appointment without asking an administrator to do
it manually.

Unlike a general-purpose booking link, PeerSlot is built around educational
rules. The first version focuses on a deliberately narrow workflow:

- A student may reschedule an appointment only once.
- The change must happen more than 24 hours before the current appointment.
- The replacement must be an available future slot with the same teacher.
- Two students can never claim the same slot.

> [!NOTE]
> PeerSlot is in active development. Provider authentication, onboarding,
> booking pages, availability calculation, and the localized provider workspace
> are in place. The student appointment and rescheduling workflow is still being
> implemented.

## The problem

Student meetings are often recurring or assigned in advance. When a student
needs a different time, a teacher or coordinator has to check availability,
move the meeting, notify everyone, and ensure the change does not create a
conflict.

PeerSlot makes that process self-service while keeping the teacher's scheduling
policy in control.

## Core workflow

1. A teacher creates free-time windows that derive meeting slots.
2. A student signs in and sees their upcoming appointment.
3. PeerSlot determines whether that appointment may be changed.
4. The student chooses from valid, unoccupied alternatives.
5. The server performs the change atomically.
6. The appointment records that its one permitted reschedule has been used.

## Planned MVP

### Student experience

- Sign in securely
- View the next scheduled meeting
- See whether the meeting is eligible for rescheduling
- Browse valid replacement times
- Confirm a one-time appointment change
- Receive useful feedback when a slot becomes unavailable

### Teacher experience

- Create, preview, edit, publish, and remove availability windows
- Review upcoming appointments
- View open times and recent booking notifications
- Manage booking-page publication and scheduling defaults

### Scheduling guarantees

- One reschedule per appointment
- A strict 24-hour cutoff
- No double-booking
- Server-side authorization for every protected operation
- Database constraints for shared scheduling state
- UTC storage with timezone-aware presentation

Better Auth provides email/password sessions, short-lived JWT access tokens,
and optional Google and Facebook OAuth. PeerSlot application APIs accept
15-minute JWTs; the revocable Better Auth session is used to issue and refresh
them. Public verification keys are exposed through JWKS. Authentication
establishes who the user is. Provider onboarding creates a profile and one
public booking page with an eight-character slug. The profile grants the
capability to publish availability, while every authenticated user can book
appointments.

FullCalendar and Resend are installed for the later calendar and notification
work, but are not integrated into the current UI yet.

## Architecture

PeerSlot is designed as a modular Next.js monolith. React and the App Router
provide the user interface, server actions or route handlers enforce the
application rules, and Neon Postgres owns durable scheduling state.

```mermaid

    Student["Student"]
    Teacher["Teacher"]

    Database["Neon Postgres"]

    Student --> App
    Teacher --> App
    App --> Auth
    App --> Database
```

There is no separate microservice backend in the MVP. Keeping the application
in one TypeScript codebase makes the project faster to build and easier to
deploy while the workflow is being validated.

## Initial data model

Better Auth manages its authentication records in Neon. PeerSlot initially
uses six application tables:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PROFILES ||--o| PROVIDER_PROFILES : enables
    PROVIDER_PROFILES ||--|| BOOKING_PAGES : publishes
    BOOKING_PAGES ||--o{ AVAILABILITY_WINDOWS : owns
    AVAILABILITY_WINDOWS ||--o{ AVAILABILITY_SLOTS : derives
    PROFILES ||--o{ APPOINTMENTS : attends
    AVAILABILITY_SLOTS ||--o| APPOINTMENTS : reserves

    PROFILES {
        text user_id PK
        timestamptz created_at
    }

    PROVIDER_PROFILES {
        text user_id PK
        text display_name
        text professional_title
        text time_zone
        integer default_appointment_duration_minutes
        integer minimum_booking_notice_minutes
        integer rest_between_sessions_minutes
        timestamptz created_at
        timestamptz updated_at
    }

    BOOKING_PAGES {
        uuid id PK
        text provider_id FK,UK
        text slug UK
        text title
        text time_zone
        integer appointment_duration_minutes
        integer booking_interval_minutes
        integer minimum_notice_hours
        boolean is_published
        timestamptz created_at
        timestamptz updated_at
    }

    AVAILABILITY_WINDOWS {
        uuid id PK
        uuid booking_page_id FK
        timestamptz starts_at
        timestamptz ends_at
        boolean is_active
        timestamptz created_at
        timestamptz updated_at
    }

    AVAILABILITY_SLOTS {
        uuid id PK
        text teacher_id FK
        uuid availability_window_id FK
        timestamptz starts_at
        timestamptz ends_at
        timestamptz created_at
    }

    APPOINTMENTS {
        uuid id PK
        text student_id FK
        uuid slot_id FK
        integer reschedule_count
        enum status
        timestamptz created_at
        timestamptz updated_at
    }
```

The appointment's `slot_id` will be unique so PostgreSQL, rather than a
browser-side check, prevents double-booking. The database will also constrain
`reschedule_count` to `0` or `1`.

Each provider has exactly one booking page in the MVP. Its unique
eight-character slug is a public locator, not an authentication credential.
Providers can publish or hide the page and rotate the slug immediately if a
link is compromised.

Providers enter free-time windows in their booking-page time zone. The API
stores the instants as UTC-backed `timestamptz` values and derives individual
appointment starts using the page's duration and booking interval. Active
windows cannot overlap. Disabling a window removes its unbooked derived slots;
windows and slots referenced by appointments are retained for history.

The public availability service accepts a booking page and UTC date range,
loads its active windows, and returns ordered appointment times that fit fully
inside those windows and the requested range. It applies minimum notice,
scheduled-appointment, and disabled-window rules server-side. Each result
includes English and Turkish labels formatted in the provider's time zone. For
the MVP, appointment duration and booking interval must be equal so generated
times cannot overlap.

An audit table for reschedule history can be introduced after the basic
workflow is working.

## Rescheduling safely

The reschedule operation must be one server-controlled database operation. It
will update an appointment only when all of these conditions are true:

1. The signed-in student owns the appointment.
2. The appointment is still scheduled.
3. Its reschedule count is zero.
4. Its current start time is more than 24 hours away.
5. The new slot is in the future and belongs to the same teacher.
6. The new slot is not occupied.

If two requests race for the same replacement slot, a unique database
constraint allows only one to succeed.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- pnpm

### Install and run

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd peerslot
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Provider registration and sign-in are available at
`http://localhost:3000/en/auth/provider`. Email/password, Google, and Facebook
authentication all continue into the same setup form. It defaults rest time to
10 minutes, creates the provider's booking page, and redirects to the dashboard.

### Localization

The website is available in English at `/en` and Turkish at `/tr`. Visiting
the root URL selects a locale from the saved preference or the browser's
language and redirects to the matching localized route. Page copy and metadata
live in `messages/en.json` and `messages/tr.json`. API routes remain unprefixed
under `/api`.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and provide the Neon connection string,
Better Auth secret, application URL, and any OAuth credentials you enable.
Secrets must remain in local environment files and must never be committed.

## Development principles

- **Keep the student flow focused.** Students should see valid choices, not an
  administrative calendar.
- **Enforce policy on the server.** Client-side validation is for usability,
  not security.
- **Let PostgreSQL protect shared state.** Constraints are the final defense
  against scheduling races.
- **Derive slots from explicit windows.** Recurring availability can be added
  after the fundamental workflow is reliable.
- **Use color accessibly.** Calendar states also need text labels or icons.
- **Avoid speculative infrastructure.** The application remains a monolith
  until real requirements justify another service.
